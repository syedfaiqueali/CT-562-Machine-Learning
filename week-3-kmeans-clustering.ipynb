It will be demonstrated using unsupervised ML technique (KMeans Clustering Algorithm) in the simplest form.</p>\n  <p><strong>Content:</strong> You are owning a supermarket mall and through membership cards, you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score. Spending Score is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.</p>\n  <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> You own the mall and want to understand the customers like who can be easily converge [Target Customers] so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.</p>\n  <p><strong>Acknowledgements:</strong> From Udemy's Machine Learning A-Z course.
